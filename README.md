# D&amp;D Bet Calculator

A Python betting odds calculator for D&amp;D games. This was a simple experiment built to help me handle betting in a tabletop roleplaying game I run. It can handle multiple bets on the same ticket with fractional odds. It takes in the bets and prints the winnings using the D&amp;D or Pathfinder currency system: pieces of copper, silver, gold, and platinum.
